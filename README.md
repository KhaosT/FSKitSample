# FSKit Sample

‚ÑπÔ∏è Apple said FSKit is part of macOS 15.4. While it's technically true (aka you can mount a custom FS after a bunch of config changes), I'm not sure it's ready as a consumer facing feature.

FSKit is the new framework introduced in macOS Sequoia that enables the developer to provide custom filesystem support from user space. The document is almost non-existent at the moment so here is a sample project to show how to use the framework.

`UnaryFilesystemExtension` is the entry point of your custom filesystem. The implementation should return an instance of your custom filesystem implementation.

The filesystem should be a subclass of `FSUnaryFileSystem` and conforms to necessary protocols, specifically `FSUnaryFileSystemOperations` as the system invokes that when deciding if the custom FS should be used, and get the volume from the extension.

From there, you can create your own subclass of `FSVolume` to help manage your volume and conform to `FSVolume.Operations` to support the basic volume specific operations. For a fully functional volume implementation, you‚Äôll probably need to conform to most of the `FSVolume.*Operations`.

As of macOS 15.4, the OS will not load the custom FS extensions by default, and you have to manually add the bundle identifier to `~/Library/Group Containers/group.com.apple.fskit.settings/enabledModules.plist` (Without that trying to mount a FS we get the error `fskitd	-[fskitdXPCServer applyResource:targetBundle:instanceID:initiatorAuditToken:authorizingAuditToken:isProbe:usingBlock:]: Attempt to start disabled extension ...`). I assume there suppose to have a way to enable the extension but I'm unable to find it since there is pretty much ZERO documentation around actually how to interact with this framework üôÉ.

Once you build and run the app, you should be able to mount the FS with something like these (`disk18` is a block device)

```
mkdir /tmp/TestVol
mount -F -t MyFS disk18 /tmp/TestVol
```

And unmount them with

```
umount /tmp/TestVol
```

To create a dummy block device to test this, you can do the following

```
mkfile -n 100m dummy // create a dummy file
hdiutil attach -imagekey diskimage-class=CRawDiskImage -nomount dummy // mount the newly created file as a raw block device
```

and then use it with your FS.
